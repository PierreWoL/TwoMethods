# SILM


### Training Requirements

* Python 3.11.0
* PyTorch 2.2.1
* Transformers 4.38.2
* NVIDIA Apex

Install requirements:
```
pip install -r requirements
```

### Datasets
All datasets, including GoogleSearch(for testing running time), WDC: 602 tables from Web Data Commons
and GDS: 660 selected tables from Google Dataset Search, can be downloaded in this repo.

### Running the offline pre-training pipeline:


The main entry point is `SwAV.py` (For serial running, please use `Serial_swav.py`). For slurm system, please see the heading 
of the script from the SwAV [Github](https://github.com/facebookresearch/swav/tree/main/scripts).
The specific implementation of SwAV for tables is in `learning` folder.
Our script is for PBS system which uses qsub.
If you only want to train using subject attributes, please write `--subject_column \` in the script.
Script for fine-tuned training and encoding is `swav.sh`, script for pretrain language models encoding
is `pretrain.sh`.

We uploaded the model in the hugging face.


Hyperparameters:

* `--batch_size`, `--base_lr`, `--n_epochs`, `--max_len`: standard batch size, learning rate, number of training epochs, max sequence length
* `--datasetSize`: the total number of tables from the given datasets
* `--percentage_crops`: the proportion of cells chosen from the each column based on TFIDF scores of each tokenized cell,
percentage_crops is a list, you can put several proportion for training. (default number: [0.5, 0.3])
* `--nmb_crops`: The --nmb_crops parameter specifies the number of views (or "crops") 
to be generated from the input tables based on the proportions defined in the --percentage_crops parameter. 
Each element in the list corresponds to a specific proportion of cells to be selected from each column, 
as defined by the percentage_crops parameter.
Example:
If the default value [2, 0] is used, it means:
For the first proportion (0.5 from percentage_crops), generate 2 views.
For the second proportion (0.3 from percentage_crops), generate 0 views.

* `--epsilon`: please see SwAV paper, we recommend 0.01/ 0.03 in the test.
* `--nmb_prototypes`: the total number of prototypes (cluster centers)
* `--lm`: the language model (we use roberta for all the experiments)
* `--size`: the maximum number of tables/columns used during pre-training
* `--projector`: the dimension of projector
* `--save_model`: if this flag is on, the model checkpoint will be saved to the directory specified in the `--logdir` flag
* `--augment_op`: augmentation operator for contrastive learning. Using "sample cells TFIDF", uses sample_cells_TFIDF; Using "sample cells", using sample_cells
* `--fp16`: half-precision training (always turn this on)
* `--save_model`: whether to save the vectors in a pickle file, which is then used in the online processing
`swavEncoder.py` is used to encode tables, it provides a simple example at the end.

### P1-P3
Hyperparameters
* `--dataset`: dataset name 
* `--embed`: name of used language name, only support sbert, bert. roberta
* `--baseline`: if this flag is on, we will run D3L as our baseline
* `--clustering`: the clustering algorithm name, defined as agglomerative clustering

* `--iteration`: iteration over clustering.
* `--subjectCol`: if we only take the subject attributes' embedding while using all the embeddings of all tables' attributes.

* `--step`: different phases, default 1 as Phase 1
* `--estimateNumber`: the estimate cluster number

* `--intervalSlice`: the interval when slicing the dendrogram
* `--delta`: delta for best silhouette score in Phase 3 -- hierarchy inference

* `--similarity`: the similarity threshold in conceptual attribute relationship search
* `--portion`: the fraction threshold for non-subject attributes in relationship search
* `--Euclidean`: distance metric, if this flag is on, we will use Euclidean distance


* `--SelectType`: This is for end-to-end part, input is the top level types in the ground truth, if this is "", we default
this as all inputting all tables
* `--P1Embed`: the embedding file for P1 
* `--P23Embed`: the embedding file for P2 & P3 


### End to end evaluation


### Running time
The main entry point is `main.py`. Script for training is `Runtime.sh`.
* `--tableNumber`: the number of tables when testing the running time.
